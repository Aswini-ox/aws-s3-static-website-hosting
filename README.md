# 🌐 Static Website Hosting using AWS S3



---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to **host a static website using Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)**.  
It covers every step from creating an S3 bucket to making the website publicly accessible through the S3 endpoint URL.

By using S3 for web hosting, we can deploy HTML, CSS, and image files easily without managing any server — making it a **simple, scalable, and cost-effective** cloud solution.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

###  1️⃣ Bucket Creation
A new **S3 bucket** named `aswini-static-website-2025` was created in AWS to store the website files.

###  2️⃣ Upload Website Files
Website files like **index.html**, **style.css**, and images were uploaded into the S3 bucket.

###  3️⃣ Enable Static Website Hosting
The **Static Website Hosting** feature was enabled under the **Properties** tab, and the **index document** and **error document** were defined.

###  4️⃣ Configure Bucket Policy
A **public read access policy** was applied so that users can view the website via the S3 link.

###  5️⃣ Modify Public Access Settings
The **“Block all public access”** option was disabled to make the website publicly reachable.

###  6️⃣ Website Testing
The website endpoint URL was opened in the browser — displaying the uploaded **HTML and CSS content** successfully.

## ✅ Final Result

The **static website** was successfully hosted using **Amazon S3**.  
All configurations and permissions were applied correctly, and the website is **publicly accessible** through the generated **S3 endpoint URL**.  
This project shows that **AWS S3** is a **secure, reliable, and easy-to-use** platform for static web hosting.
